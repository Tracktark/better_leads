# About
Leads in Minecraft are pretty annoying to use. Your horse tries to run away when you want to tie it to a fence and when you finally do, you forget to untie it when you want to leave. After you finally untie it, the item drops on the ground, so you now need to wait to pick it up, or more likely, you just forget it and let it despawn. This datapack aims to fix that, while keeping the vanilla feel.
# Features
- Right clicking a fence with a lead while mounted will tie your horse without having to leave its back
- Getting on a horse which is tied to a fence will automatically untie it
- Shift-Right clicking a leash knot will transfer the leash to your hand
- Untying a leash knot will now put the items directly into your inventory, instead of dropping on the ground
# Known Issues
- Because of weird implementation details in Minecraft, some features of this datapack currently only work in survival mode
